# Middle Earth API

The purpose of this project is, primarily, to provide information from the Middle Earth: a universe I learned to love and admire. All of this, as an API. 

Besides that, to me, it's a way to demonstrate how to handle a few approaches to people that I interact in a daily basis, as well as a sandbox that goes beyond the classical... sandbox. My idea in here, specially when I mention that this project, at the end of the day, is a sandbox, is to make it clear that I won't go crazy in best practices, best solutions for an specific scenario, etc., this is something that I am going to work at my own pace and when the right situations come up, which may be soon or may be in the future. 

This project is not complete by now, but I plan to include more and more scenarios from time to time. By doing that, eventually I'll refactor a bunch of the code that was in place, so I really consider this as a work in progress which is not fully defined yet (specially regarding its architecture) how is going to end, but definetely is going to be an unexpected party.
